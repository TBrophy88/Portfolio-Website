### Tom Brophy's Portfolio Website

This is a personal website I created to function as a portfolio.

The homepage features particle effects with various controls including a 'time control' feature utilizing react-redux for state management.

Created using:
Create-React-App,
React-Redux,
React-Konva,
D3

A live version can be found ~~[here]~~ website no longer active.
